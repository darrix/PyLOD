# PyLOD
PyLOD is a Python wrapper for exposing Linked Open Data from public SPARQL-served endpoints. It acts as an abstraction layer for the retrieval of structured data, such as classes, properties and individuals, without requiring any knowledge of SPARQL.

## Getting Started

PyLOD is a minimal module for Python 2.x. Support for Python 3.x will be tested and added soon.

### Prerequisites

[SPARQLWrapper](https://rdflib.github.io/sparqlwrapper/) - SPARQLWrapper is a simple Python wrapper around a SPARQL service to remotelly execute queries.
